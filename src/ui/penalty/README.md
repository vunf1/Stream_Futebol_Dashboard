## JSON Structure

The penalty state is stored in `gameinfo.json` under the `penalties` field:

```json
{
  "penalties": {
    "initial": 5,
    "starts": "home",              // "home" | "away"
    "stage": "initial",            // "initial" | "sudden" | "done"
    "home": ["goal","goal","fail","pending","pending"],
    "away": ["fail","goal","goal","pending","pending"],
    "next": { "team": "home", "index": 3 },  // or null when done
    "winner": null                              // "home" | "away" | null
  }
}
```

## Logic Rules

### Early Finish Detection
- If one team scores more goals than the other team can possibly score with remaining penalties, the shootout ends immediately
- Example: Home has 3 goals, Away has 0 goals, and Away has only 2 penalties remaining ‚Üí Home wins

### Sudden Death
- When initial round ends in a tie, automatically transitions to sudden death
- Each team takes one penalty at a time until one team scores and the other misses
- Grid expands infinitely to accommodate additional penalties

### Next Penalty Logic
- **Initial Stage**: Finds next pending penalty within the initial round
- **Sudden Death**: Finds next pending penalty in the extended grid
- **Done Stage**: No next penalty (null)
